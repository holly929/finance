# Firebase Studio

## Firebase Console

The Firebase Console is the primary interface for managing your Firebase project, including setting up and configuring Firebase App Hosting. You'll use the console to connect your project to your GitHub repository, configure deployment settings, and monitor your deployments.


This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
